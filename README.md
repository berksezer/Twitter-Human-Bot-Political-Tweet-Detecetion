# Twitter-Human-Bot-Political-Tweet-Detecetion

In this project we have developed two Machine Learning models by using various Machine Learning algorithms. 

One of the model was predicting if a twitter user was a bot or real. 

The second model was predicting if a tweet is a political or a non-political tweet.
